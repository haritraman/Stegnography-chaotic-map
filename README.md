🔐 Advanced Steganography: 
AES-Chaotic Map LSB EmbeddingThis repository contains a robust steganography system that securely hides a secret file within a cover image using a hybrid cryptographic approach. It combines high-standard AES-256 GCM encryption with Chaotic Map dynamics to enhance both the secrecy and resilience of the embedded payload.
💡 Core Functionality and Security FeaturesThe implementation utilizes the Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding technique, fortified by three layers of key-dependent security:
1. AES-256 GCM Encryption: The secret file is encrypted and authenticated using the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. The output is a secure blob
2. Chaotic Keystream Scrambling (XOR): The encrypted blob is further secured by an XOR operation with a pseudo-random keystream generated by a Logistic Chaotic Map. This non-linear scrambling layer ensures high diffusion and avalanche effect, making cryptanalysis significantly harder even if the LSB mechanism is exposed.
3. Chaotic Permutation Embedding: Instead of embedding bits sequentially, the pixel-channel positions are selected according to a key-dependent, pseudo-random permutation generated by the Logistic Map. This destroys the spatial correlation of the hidden data, acting as a crucial defense against statistical steganalyzers.

⚙️ Prerequisites
To run the script, ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

        pip install Pillow numpy cryptography


  🔑 Configuration and Setup
The security of the steganography relies on two essential secret keys defined within the main script (stego.py). These keys MUST be changed for secure deployment.

1. Key Configuration
Locate and modify the following variables in stego.py:

Variable                    Type                                             Description

AES_KEY_HEX,Hex         String (32 chars)                Base key used to derive the 256-bit AES key.
CHAOS_KEY             String (Passphrase)            Secret phrase used to initialize the chaotic map parameters for both scrambling and permutation.



2. Input Files
Place the following two files in the same directory as the script:



Filename                Role                                        Notes

image.jpg           Cover Image                      The original image used as the container.
script.sh             Secret File                    The data payload to be hidden (any file type).


▶️ Execution
The script executes the full steganography workflow: encryption, embedding, extraction, and decryption.

Run Command:    python stego.py


Generated Output
The script will create three output files in the local directory:

  
Filename                         Description                                  Purpose

stegoImg.png                Steganographic Output                The final image containing the hidden payload.
cover.png              PNG copy of the original cover.           Used internally for consistent processing.
extracted.sh                  Recovered File                              The file recovered after extraction and decryption. This should be a bit-for-bit match of the original script.sh.


📊 Performance and Quality Metrics
The console output includes metrics demonstrating the minimal visual impact of the LSB embedding:

Example Console Output:

Embedding done -> stegoImg.png
Recovered file written to extracted.sh
MSE:  0.000003
PSNR: 84.1567 dB

MSE (Mean Squared Error): A minimal value indicates negligible statistical deviation between the cover and stego images.
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): A value in the high 80s dB confirms that the distortion from embedding is visually imperceptible and well above the threshold typically used in digital steganography
